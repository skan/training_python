   The Goal

The goal for your program is to make a motorbike jump across a gap and land on a platform then stop.
   Rules

The platform is located on the otherside of a gap in the road above a chasm. The lengths of the road, gap and platform are measured in cells.

road__gap__platform
 
At the start of the program, you are given:
   The variable road: the length of the road before the gap.
   The variable gap: the length of the gap.
   The variable platform: the length of the platform.

At the start of each game turn, the motorbike gives you:
   The variable speed: its current speed.
   The variable coordX: its position on the road.
   The motorbike's initial position is coordX = 0. 
      It always moves in a straight line. 
      At the end of each turn, 
         it moves forward a number of spaces equal to its speed (speed). 
         For example, if coordX = 1 and speed = 3, coordX will be 4 at the next turn. 
         The bike can start with any speed, including being at a stop.
 
Before the end of the turn, you must output one of the following commands:
   SPEED: increases the speed of the motorbike by 1 (+1 to the speed variable).
   SLOW: decreases the speed of the motorbike by 1 (-1 to the speed variable).
   JUMP: makes the motorbike jump.
   WAIT: does nothing (the motorbike keeps the same speed).
